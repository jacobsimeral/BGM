This code is not optimized for production and is not always well written. This code is intended to test specific differences between calibrations using different spot curves. Certain parts of the model were based on assumptions and may not exactly match the model it was meant to emulate. Some sections are also simplified from the true production model. In some areas of code, I comment out other potential ways of implementing a block of code.
